## Iteration 1 - TC-001: Pay Period Config Model

### What was implemented
- Added `PayPeriodConfig` model to Prisma schema with:
  - id, type, startDayOfWeek, startDate, timestamps
  - type supports: weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly
- Extended `UserPermissions` type with `canManageConfig` in timeclock section
- Created `/api/timeclock/config` API route with:
  - GET endpoint returning pay period configuration (with singleton auto-creation)
  - PUT endpoint for updating configuration with validation
  - Permission check for `canManageConfig`
  - Audit logging for config changes
- Created `/admin/timeclock` admin UI page with:
  - Pay period type selector (radio buttons with descriptions)
  - Start day of week dropdown (for weekly/biweekly)
  - Reference start date picker (for biweekly)
  - Loading skeleton, error/success alerts
  - Permission-based access control (redirects if unauthorized)

### Key decisions
- Used singleton pattern for PayPeriodConfig (only one config per system)
- Auto-create default config on first GET request
- Start day of week only shown for weekly/biweekly types
- Reference start date only shown for biweekly type

### Files created/modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added PayPeriodConfig model
- `src/lib/check-permissions.ts` - Added canManageConfig permission
- `src/app/api/timeclock/config/route.ts` - New API route
- `src/app/admin/timeclock/page.tsx` - New admin UI page

### Quality checks
- Build passes successfully
- Database migration applied without errors
