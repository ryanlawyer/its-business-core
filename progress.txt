## Progress Log

## Iteration 1 - TC-001: Pay Period Config Model

### What was implemented
- Added `PayPeriodConfig` model to Prisma schema with:
  - id, type, startDayOfWeek, startDate, timestamps
  - type supports: weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly
- Extended `UserPermissions` type with `canManageConfig` in timeclock section
- Created `/api/timeclock/config` API route with:
  - GET endpoint returning pay period configuration (with singleton auto-creation)
  - PUT endpoint for updating configuration with validation
  - Permission check for `canManageConfig`
  - Audit logging for config changes
- Created `/admin/timeclock` admin UI page with:
  - Pay period type selector (radio buttons with descriptions)
  - Start day of week dropdown (for weekly/biweekly)
  - Reference start date picker (for biweekly)
  - Loading skeleton, error/success alerts
  - Permission-based access control (redirects if unauthorized)

### Key decisions
- Used singleton pattern for PayPeriodConfig (only one config per system)
- Auto-create default config on first GET request
- Start day of week only shown for weekly/biweekly types
- Reference start date only shown for biweekly type

### Files created/modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added PayPeriodConfig model
- `src/lib/check-permissions.ts` - Added canManageConfig permission
- `src/app/api/timeclock/config/route.ts` - New API route
- `src/app/admin/timeclock/page.tsx` - New admin UI page

### Quality checks
- Build passes successfully
- Database migration applied without errors

## Iteration 2 - TC-002: Overtime Config Model

### What was implemented
- Added `OvertimeConfig` model to Prisma schema with:
  - id, dailyThreshold, weeklyThreshold (nullable Int for minutes)
  - alertBeforeDaily, alertBeforeWeekly (nullable Int for minutes)
  - notifyEmployee, notifyManager (Boolean defaults)
  - timestamps
- Extended `/api/timeclock/config` API route:
  - GET now returns both `payPeriodConfig` and `overtimeConfig`
  - PUT handles overtime fields: dailyThreshold, weeklyThreshold, alertBeforeDaily, alertBeforeWeekly, notifyEmployee, notifyManager
  - Singleton auto-creation with sensible defaults (8h daily, 40h weekly)
  - Validation for positive integers or null
  - Separate audit logging for overtime config changes
- Extended `/admin/timeclock` admin UI page with:
  - Tabbed interface (Pay Periods / Overtime Rules)
  - Daily threshold input (in hours, converted to minutes for API)
  - Weekly threshold input (in hours, converted to minutes for API)
  - Alert threshold inputs (in minutes)
  - Employee notification checkbox
  - Manager notification checkbox
  - Helper functions for hours/minutes conversion

### Key decisions
- Used singleton pattern for OvertimeConfig (matches PayPeriodConfig pattern)
- Thresholds stored in minutes but displayed in hours for UX
- Alert thresholds remain in minutes (finer granularity useful)
- Null values disable the respective threshold
- Separate save buttons per tab to avoid accidental overwrites
- Maintained backwards compatibility with `config` field in API response

### Files modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added OvertimeConfig model
- `src/app/api/timeclock/config/route.ts` - Extended for overtime handling
- `src/app/admin/timeclock/page.tsx` - Added overtime settings tab

### Quality checks
- Build passes successfully
- Database migration applied without errors

## Iteration 3 - TC-003: Manager Assignment Model

### What was implemented
- Added `ManagerAssignment` model to Prisma schema with:
  - userId, departmentId with unique constraint
  - Relations to User and Department models
  - Cascade delete on both relations
  - Indexes on userId and departmentId
- Added `canAssignManagers` permission to UserPermissions type
- Created `/api/timeclock/manager-assignments` API route with:
  - GET: List all assignments (with optional userId/departmentId filter)
  - POST: Create new assignment with validation
  - DELETE: Remove assignment by userId and departmentId
  - Permission check for `canAssignManagers`
  - Audit logging for assignment changes
- Created `/admin/timeclock/managers` admin UI page with:
  - Form to add new manager-department assignment
  - User and department dropdowns
  - Grouped view showing managers and their assigned departments
  - Department overview table showing which managers are assigned
  - Remove assignment with confirmation
  - Loading skeleton and error/success alerts

### Key decisions
- Used composite unique constraint on (userId, departmentId)
- Grouped assignments by user in UI for cleaner display
- Included department overview table for quick visibility
- Used chips with X button for easy removal of assignments

### Files created/modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added ManagerAssignment model and relations
- `src/lib/check-permissions.ts` - Added canAssignManagers permission
- `src/app/api/timeclock/manager-assignments/route.ts` - New API route
- `src/app/admin/timeclock/managers/page.tsx` - New admin UI page

### Quality checks
- Build passes successfully
- Database migration applied without errors
